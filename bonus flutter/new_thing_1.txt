LISTVIEW WIDGET AS A CHILD OF COLUMN WIDGET.

1. In flutter if you add children in column or row then the parent i.e. the column tells its 
children that you can take as much space as you all need. My dimensions will be total sum of you lot.
Now this is okay as long as the children have definite dimension. 
Now suppose that we add a listview as child in column. The column again asks its child i.e. 
listview about how much space it needs. Listview says that i will take as much space as i can get.
and column then fumbles and is now under pressure as "as much space as i can get" means infinity.
And hence we see the error of viewport something something. 
A quick fix is to wrap the listview widget around expanded widget or a sizedbox.
