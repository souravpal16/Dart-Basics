# Dart-Basics
<h2>Here I present the basics of dart language, the official development language followed by flutter SDK, developed by google.<br></h2>
I will constantly update this repository every day as an initiative for #30daysOfCode. I would talk about all the basics of dart in detail along with explanatory text files and would try to cover all the official blogs and videos for dart. Talking about flutter once in a while would also not be uncommon.
